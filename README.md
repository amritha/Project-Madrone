#Project Madrone

Hey guys,

We're @amrithap and @sabrina. Two girls who got together one labor day weekend, locked themselves up in a remote forest house, and forced ourselves to learn how to code.

Hope you enjoy our very first project together and very first real project on github! 

I'll depart with some wise words from a very wise man:
