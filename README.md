#Project Madrone

Hey guys,

We're Amritha (@amrithap) and Sabrina (@sabrina). Two girls who got together one labor day weekend, locked themselves up in a remote forest house, and forced themselves to learn how to code.

Hope you enjoy our very first project together and very first real project on github! 

I'll depart with some wise words from a very wise man:

"I ain't playin girl. Don't think you realize. How you like yo eggs? Fried or Fertilized?" -Yung Humma
